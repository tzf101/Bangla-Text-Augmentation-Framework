_Authors: Md. Tariquzzaman, Audwit Nafi Anam, Naimul Haque, Mohsinul Kabir, Hasan Mahmud, Md Kamrul Hasan_

## Overview
BDA is a framework designed to improve Bangla NLP tasks by generating high-quality augmented text. It combines rule-based and transformer-based methods, such as synonym replacement, back-translation, and paraphrasing, to create semantically rich variants of the original text while preserving its meaning. BDA addresses data scarcity issues in Bangla by augmenting small datasets to improve model performance.

## Features
1. Hybrid Augmentation: Combines rule-based techniques (e.g., synonym replacement, random insertions) with transformer-based methods (e.g., back-translation, paraphrasing).
2. Filtering: Ensures that augmented data is semantically and lexically similar to the original text.

BDA provides significant improvements in F1 scores with only 50% of the original dataset which effectively solves the data scarcity problem in Bangla NLP tasks.
